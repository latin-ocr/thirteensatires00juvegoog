Tho rich man is borne through the streete in a litter, where he may read

⁴ or sleep at ease; tho poor ie hustled by crowds, bumped by logs oi

timber, trampled on bya soldier's hob-nailed boote. Aclient,returning

home with his slave bearing hie dinner in a chafing dish, ie crushed

to death under a wagon-load ol marble. His household is making

ready to receive him, but he the while covers on the shores ol Styx,
and has not whorewithal to pay Charon's tce (aes-267).

Danger oi a broken head, from sherds thrown from the vindows of the l.

upper stories (uos-277). Danger irom ‘Mohocks’ who prowl in
, search oi adventures, and after leaving you scarce a tooth in your
· mouth, as injured innocente would fain take the law oi you (278-301).

- Danger trem burglars and banditti3 happy the days when one prison
sufficed lor Rome's neede (soa-314).

Umbricius could say more, but time presses. He begs lua, whenever he
, visits his native Aquinum, to send word to Gumae; and promises to
support his obtemptu to reform the age (sle-322).

household was being packed in one coach, Umbricius halted at the
ancient arches ot tho dripping Capenian gata. Here where once Numa
made assignatione by night with his goddess mistress, where now the grove
and shrine of the sacred spring are lot to J ews, whose whole iurniture ie
a basket and a truss ot hay-ior every tres must by law pay rent to the
state, and the wood after the expulsion oi its Muses begs [is a beggars’
haunt]-we stepped down into Egeria’s vale and grottoes-how all unlike

edged its waves with green and no marble protaned the native tufa!
