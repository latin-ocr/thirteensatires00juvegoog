As the first editiones this book hasbeen out of print
for several years, and some months must olapse before
Ι can hope for loisure to continue the notes I have
resolved to issue at once the text and the explanatory
notes as far as thoy are printed off.

The notes of Stanley and John Taylor‚ which are
cited here and there, are taken from their ‘MSS in the
Cambridge university library; those of Markland are
preserved in st J ohn’s college.

For the notes bearing the initials H* A. J. M. and
J. O. I am indebted to my friends Professor Munro and
the lamented Professor Conington.

I have purposely abstainod from consulting any

English edition of Juvenal. All the citations have been

taken anew from· the original authors.
