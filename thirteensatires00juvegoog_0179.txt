which hove driven him from Rome. There is no room for honest
men, where they only thrive who will melre blaclr white end embrece
the meenest employment for guin (21-40); he who cannot lie, who
will not play the geme of parricides 1111111111, oppressore, ie 1 use·
lese eripple. To win the petronege of the great, you must be mester
of their guilty secrete (41-57). Greeks end syriane, Jccks of 111
trades, blown to Rome by the seme wind 11 fige und demseris, ouet
the native of the Aventine3 for they cen act any part, taking their cue
from their lord's chenging moods; they corrupt his wife, his daughter,
his very grnndmother. Under the neme of stoice they betruy their
pupils; by 1 few drope of the poison of celumny they supplent the
oldest end most faithful cliente (58-125).

Nor do foreignere alone thwert the poor client; praetore themselves, in
111 their 11111, attend the leveee of rich orbae: men ot gentle blood
escort wenlthy freedmen (me-136). Scipio Nasica, ‘the best cf
Romans,’ Numa or Metellus, would not be believed on their 111111,
